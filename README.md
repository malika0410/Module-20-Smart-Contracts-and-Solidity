## 1. Overview of the Project

In this project, we will create a smart contract using Solidity and deploy it to the Javascript VM. The smart contract will use ether management functions to implement a financial institution. The smart contract will be able to accept deposits, withdraw funds, and check balances. The smart contract will also be able to transfer funds between accounts.

## 2. Steps Involved

    1. Create a Joint Savings Account Contract in Solidity
    2. Compile and Deploy Your Contract in the JavaScript VM
    3. Interact with Your Deployed Smart Contract
